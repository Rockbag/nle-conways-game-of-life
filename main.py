# Conway's Game Of Life
# The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
# each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively).
# Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or
# diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

# 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
# 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
